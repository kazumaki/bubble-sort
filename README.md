## General info
This project was built so as to implement a bubble sorting algorithm. It makes use of yield and passing a method to it. The first method 'bubble_sort' takes in an array and returns a sorted array without the use of the built-in sort method. The second method 'bubble_sort_by' takes in a block which has two arguments that represent the two elements that are currently being compared. It makes use of the yield and passing a block to the function being called. It is created and built by <a href="https://github.com/adaorachi">MaryAnn Chukwuka</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kazumaki">Vinicius Campos Carvalho</a>.
